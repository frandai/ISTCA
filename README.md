# Information System for Training Courses Administration

In this document it is presented the analysis, development and implementation of an information systemwhich is based on new web technologies to the continuing professional development administrative process:what methodology was made use for carrying out the system, what tools and technologies have been used inorder to face the system requirements, how the different parts of the system have been designed andimplemented, how the implemented system is used and what benefits from the use of the system has been ledfor its users.

In this report many analysis techniques have been used, development and software engineering, thatcombined together turned out to be a robust and compliant system to the users needs.

Effective technologies and methodologies have helped with the analysis, development and implementation ofthe information system, such as: the use of software architecture pattern Model-View-Controller; the use ofentity-relationship models and relational model for the design of the database; the use of softwareengineering techniques such as agile development and extreme programming; using Java Server Faces andtechnology for development; the use of virtualization to implement the system.

There is also explained the project implementation: the hierarchy of pages in the system, what group offunctions have the system's code, how can the system be installed in an environment of production, how itinteracts with the system.As a result, there is a system which provides with ease the administration of training courses by differentcompanies: academies, consulting businesses or public entities. The system make easier the communicationbetween actors (tutors, students, businesses receiving training, financial institutions), with special attention tothe Fundación Tripartita de Formación en el Empleo (Spanish public entity) which is responsible forvalidating and finance training courses for businesses which need to train their employees.
